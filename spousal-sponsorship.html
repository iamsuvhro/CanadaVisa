                <p>My spousal and I are now happily starting our future together. Weâ€™re glad we had our Spousal sponsorship application done professionally with Bash Ali and Associates. We knew that the entire application process could be risky had we tried to do it ourselves. We have heard from our family friends that even genuine spouses were declined because they didnâ€™t satisfy the office with enough of the quality evidence that they wanted to see. We would recommend them as the counsels are very experienced and know exactly how to prove your marriage with immigration.</p>
